# SERV Real Estate Market Place: UPLY MEDIA INC. 

<h2> Buying and Selling physical Real Estate with smart contracts </h2>


<h3> Creating an interesting way to buy and sell realestate on the blockchain for UPLY MEDIA INC. </h3>

<b> *** THIS CANNOT be implemented without FIRST discussing all aspects with multiple proffesionals. *** </b>
1. DAO attorney
2. Real estate attorney
3. Title & Deed professional
4. Title Insurance professional
5. Governement officials in the real estate's jurisdiction 


As of now, the entire real estate transaction cannot be done with blockchain technology because certain crypto intruments simply do not exist just yet

But for now, I came up with the idea to use a DAO that is registered legally as an LLC in WWyoming to facilitate the transactions.

<b> ** ALL DAOs being used to facilitate real estate transactions should be registerd by a DAO attorney OR expierenced professional. ** </b>

Because a DAO that is legally registered as a business can own physical real estate properties, the members of that DAO, owns the property. 

Regradless if the DAO has only ONE meber or multiple members, the transfer of ownership can still happen once a sale is made by removing the previous members and adding in the new members. 

The DAO will mint ONE NFT that will represent the physical property. 

Once the NFT is sold the owner of the NFT will become the ONLY owner(s)/member(s) of the DAO. The pervious members will be removed. 

The remove functionality have to be agreed with all original members of the DAO. 

Before the NFT is sold, the buyer(s) and seller(s) have to go through a few steps first: 
1. ALL parties must undergo a KYC/AML process and be approved 
2. ALL identity documents are required to be submitted
3. The Deed needs to be submitted and varified by UPLY MEDIA off chain 
4. The Title needs to be submitted and varified by UPLY MEDIA off chain 

Once ALL of the conditions are met, the NFT will be transfered to the new owner(s). 
While the documents and procedures are being verified, the money being used to purchase the NFT will sit inside of an ESCROW account

Once ALL conditions are met and the sale happens, the seller(s) have a payment splittign option that will allow them to allocate the funds to different accounts. This will be beneficial if there are multiple sellers or third parties involved like an investor or a real estate agent that requies their selling or buying commisions.
